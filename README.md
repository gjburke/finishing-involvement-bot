### Note: 
The idea for the project and not all of this code is mine, look at original files folder and the old github for who is responsible for writing the other code. (Notable contributors: github users agilan123, gvvven, and whoever else worked on the front-end html that wasn't listed on the GitHub) Original files can be seen at https://github.com/agilan123/UIUC-Involvement-BOT.

## Motivation

Want to complete the project that has gone unfinished this past semester.

## Description

The UIUC Involvement Bot takes in a query of a user's interests and outputs clubs and organizations that align with the category and intensity level of the interest.
<br>
This project consists of two neural networks trained and designed for sentiment analysis of the same query. One determines the intensity level of the query (how involved the person wants to be) and the other determines the category. From the intensity level and the category, results are displayed from a database of school clubs and organizaitons that have the corresponding values.
